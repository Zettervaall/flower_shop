                    At Rose & Rue, we believe that flowers speak the language of
                    the heart. Nestled in the heart of the community, our
                    boutique flower shop is dedicated to crafting stunning
                    floral arrangements for every occasion â€” from joyful
                    celebrations to tender moments of reflection.
                </p>

                    We source our blooms from local growers whenever possible,
                    ensuring each bouquet is fresh, sustainable, and
                    thoughtfully designed. Whether you're picking up a single
                    rose or planning a grand event, Rose & Rue is here to help
                    you say it beautifully.
